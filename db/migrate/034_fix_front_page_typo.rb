These sites are dynamic because you can edit them online and provide interesting and up to date content, so that people will visit again and again. Portallus isn't the first system to do this, nor will it be the last.</p><p>So why then would you consider using Portallus for your website?<br /></p><h4>1. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">It's Dead Easy</span><br /></h4><p>Anyone can make a site with Portallus. Even your mum could do it. You don't need any special software, you don't need to know about web hosting, web design, HTML documents, uploading files, or anything. You just click a button and your site is created. Click another button and you can add a page to your site. Click again and you can edit the page straight away with the web browser you are using now. We handle things like menus, and layout, you just get your info on the web with the minimum of fuss.<br /></p><h4>2. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">It's Going Places</span><br /></h4><p>Portallus development is proceeding at a rapid pace, and we've got big ideas. Perhaps you want to add something other than plain pages to your site? That will happen. Very soon, you'll be able to add journals (or blogs), calendars, discussion forums, and all sorts of great features that you normally only see on professional web sites, installed by professional computer geeks. Portallus makes it usable by regular people, and will still provide all the features to keep the geeks happy, like RSS and Atom syndication, custom templates, and third party plugins.<br /></p><p>In addition to all these web portal features, Portallus is about Social Networking. By version 0.3, Portallus will have the first of a rich set of features aimed to let you interact with other people's websites, make connections with friends, join groups, and stay up to date with other sites automatically. We plan to support open standards, such as <a href=\"http://www.foaf-project.org/\">FOAF</a>, to ensure that you can interact with people using other social networking systems.<br /></p><h4>2. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">It's Not Evil<br /></span></h4><p>After the imminent release of version 0.2, Portallus will become a democratic community project, developed using a co-operative business model and released free as <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/\">Open Source</a> software. We, the Portallus developers, still hope to make a living developing this product. If we couldn't do that, then we wouldn't be able to still develop it for you. However, we think that we can do that, while still alowing a fair go to anyone else who wants to join in, build on our ideas, or interact with our software. Also, one of the advantages of Open Source projects like this is that even if the current developers all got run over by herds of stampeding elephants tomorrow, other developers would still be free to carry on the project if they wished.<br /></p><p><br /></p>"
