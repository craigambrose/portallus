Even of the stuff arrives on Friday, she said, there\'s not enough time to test it and I\'m not letting you put live servers on it this weekend.<br /><br />I agreed with her. This is my new tactic. These days, if you disagree with me, I generally agree with you immediately. I find people who have been agreed with to be most agreeable to negotiation. I just have to be fairly particular and careful about what I agree to. In this case I agreed that there wasn\'t enough time to test.<br /><br />Then I put my side of the story - this project was fucked for time from the outset. It STARTED a month late because the previous project ran a month overtime and nobody was around to DO it. We spent too much time arguing about the scope, too much time arguing about how we would implement the new scope, and then management spent too much time dithering about these issues, the budget and whatnot.<br /><br />Despite all of that, I must complete this project by next thursday, because I\'m leaving the company on that very day. And nobody, once I am gone, is going to have the time to finish the fucker. \'Next thursday\' then, being \'this coming thursday\' now - 5 days away.<br /><br />Then, only after first agreeing and then putting forward the background of my viewpoint, we began to negotiate. I suggested we draw up a \'timetable\' (strangely once I put something in either a spreadsheet or a diagram, people like it more, even if it doesn\'t change at all in the process) of what we could do on what day and on what night between then and D-Day. I suggested we do the stupid fucking irrelevant servers first - you know the ones that, if they go down because they\'ve been put on terminally flawed untested storage, nobody will notice for two hours? We began to get places.<br /><br />Eventually, I drew up a totally insane schedule whereby we both compromised - I allowed for a four day testing period with the caveat that I would test with the Stupid servers on the storage.<br /><br /><h3>Hindrance</h3>Then the Supplier got into full swing. Since we lost the project manager, I have been trying to fill his shoes by calling these fuckers every... single... day... twice...<br /><br />It\'s not much use. Ultimately, we haven\'t given them enough time.<br /><br />They\'ve been promising me delivery on a specific date, which happens to be today. Last night\'s phone call to them went along the lines of:<br /><br />&quot;I know you\'re not ready. I don\'t care what you do or don\'t have - send me what you have tomorrow and I\'ll deal with it. If I have to install the software, ok. If I have to freaking download the software to install - ok! If you have courier problems just let me know and I\'ll drive out to you and pick the shit up. No matter what, we move tomorrow. I know it says in the contract that you gotta supply us with the stuff fully set up, but if I can sort it out I\'ll let you off the hook there.&quot;<br /><br />That night, I finalise our methodology for iSCSI connectivity on RHE 3.0 kernels. At least I think I do. It seems good to me.<br /><br /><h3>Disaster</h3>So the shit arrives today. Woot! What seems like every piece of hardware we need turns up.<br /><br />At 1pm.<br /><br />Without the software installed.<br /><br />Without the OS installed.<br /><br />Without even the CD\'s to install the software.<br /><br />Hell, without even the CD\'s to install the OS.<br /><br />No problemo. We spend many hours getting the unfamiliar shit crammed into a rack. This is hindered by the fact that we need to remove some shitty old servers FROM the rack first. I distinctly remember the project manager pestering me every day about that, and me continually putting it off. If we hadn\'t lost him, I bet I\'d have given in before now and done it, despite its apparent irrelevance.<br /><br />Meanwhile, being quite the contingency planner, I have found out what to download from the supplier\'s supplier, and begun to download it.<br /><br />RedHat 7.3, if you will. Somewhere, deep in the back of my mind, alarm bells ring. But I have no time to listen to my inner voice today. I que up a download of the 3 cd-image files required for this distinguished (Senile) operating system, and begin downloading the 350meg software package direct from the supplier\'s supplier\'s website.<br /><br />Eventually, these finish. After some heavy discussions in Mandarin (which I do not speak a word\r\nof, but the other two sysadmins do...) we get network and power to one\r\nof the three controller boxes.<br /><br />I put CD 1 into the shiny black slimline CD drive of this 1U controller, and boot it up.<br /><br />It boots.

I wont be able to get the fucker installed with a Crowbar, a bottle of vodka, and a whole jar of lubricant. Armed with nothing but the install CD\'s of a three year old operating system, I\'m super-fucked.<br /><br />It is 7pm.<br /><br />I call the mobile number of the supplier\'s supplier\'s engineer chick (where ARE all these goddamn geek girls? Who ARE they when they\'re at home? At the pub? Do they wear shirts with &quot;geek&quot; on them like I do, for identification purposes? Do they avoid male geeks? Why do I only meet them professionally?) and not surprisingly, I get her voicemail.<br /><br />It\'s 7pm on a friday night. If I could, I\'d probably turn my god damn phone off too.<br /><br />A small popping noise is heard. This is the project breaking - changing from status: &quot;Extremely Tenuous&quot; to status: &quot;Utterly Fucked Up So Bad The Worms Wont Even Have To Chew&quot;.<br /><br />After some fruitless and depressing web searches about RH7.3 and onboard SATA RAID (HA HA HA YOU FOOL), I send a polite email to the supplier, CC\'d to the supplier\'s supplier\'s engineer chick, explaining the situation, asking for any magic assistance they might be able to render. I also query, in my quietest voice, how much communication has occurred between these two companies with respect to hardware compatibility?<br /><br />I don\'t mention it, but I\'m guessing: not... quite... enough.<br /><br />I call the Server&amp;APP Coordinator, who has sensibly gone home, and tell here there is fuckall I can do, and that nobody can do any work this weekend.

Basically if you have an insane problem (disk not \r\nmounted), this helps prevent rsync helpfully synchronise a blank volume \r\nto your backup machine\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />Performance issues:\r\n<br />* Using rsync, roughly 500GB of user files (400ish users) seems to move \r\nabout 5GB of data a day. That\'s about 7 hours over a 2Meg xDSL link. \r\n(slightly less as rsync also compresses data in transit). These are from \r\nmemory, I don\'t post from work so don\'t have the exact data, or the \r\npretty graph I made.\r\n<br />* Our mail server backups (Groupwise) are also a couple of gig per day.\r\n<br />* Doesn\'t work well on MS-SQL backup files, sends entire file every time \r\n(I think MS do something really creative with the backup file that makes \r\nit impossible to track what\'s changed\r\n<br />* Works very well on VMware virtual disk files (which must be either \r\nunmounted or a snapshot), including virtual disks that CONTAIN live \r\nMS-SQL databases\r\n<br />* 400GB of files seems to consume about 1Gig of RAM while rsyncing \r\n(again, from memory, YMMV). Going heavily into swap is unlikely to \r\neffect performance if you\'re doing it over a slow network link anyway.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />Storage requirements:\r\n<br />* The last 1TB array I built using commodity hardware cost about $3k. \r\n(and took me about eight hours of fighting with RAID controller drivers, \r\nbut that is another story\r\n<br />* I have a quote for a Promise 15drive iSCSI unit with 3.2TB of SATA \r\ndrives (WD Raid Edition, 1M hours MTBF, 7200rpm SATA) for about $12k.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />Cool stuff:\r\n<br />* Any linux machine whose data has been synchronised to another linux \r\nserver can have its <b class=\"moz-txt-star\"><span class=\"moz-txt-tag\">*</span>functionality<span class=\"moz-txt-tag\">*</span></b> brought up on the backup server, in \r\nthe event of a disaster.

INSERT INTO `blog_entries` VALUES (9,241,'Aiming with a Helm On','By my troth, being out on the field of battle is certainly not the same as shooting at the butts. For me, the current struggle is in aiming while wearing a helm. It does not block my sight any great deal, but the bulk of the thing means that my string hand, which did formely lock against my cheek with the tip of the index finger positioning itself at the corner of my mouth, now finds itself pushed out sideways by the space taken up by the helm.<br /><br />Like most archers, my aiming method could best be described as Point-Of-Aim. I attempt to remove as many variables from the shot as possible through consistant stance (note here the use of the word attempt), and then aim soley by positioning the bow such that the tip of my arrow is positioned at the appropriate place with respect to where I would dearly like to hit. The world would be a wonderful place indeed if I only needed to position that tip over the target itself, but alas, the fact that one cannot actually position their draw so as to make it possible to sight directly down the arrow, combined with the curv of the shot as the arrow falls back to earth, and the effect of the arrow being pushed sideways by my great bended stick, not to mention the occasional effect of string twist as I release, all contribute to the arrow not at all ending up at the point I spy beyond the tip of the arrow when I first loose. However, there does most certainly exist a relationship between that point in my sight, and the final resting place of the shaft, which is dependent only only upon the variances of my technique, which presumably are within my ability to master, some small effects of the wind, which I shall ignore at this point in my training, and ultimatelly by the range the the target itself.<br /><br />As I draw so that the nock ends up locking lower than my eyes, and out to the left of my head as dictated by my helm (yes, this makes my a left handed archer, but these words would apply in principle regardless of which side it occured on) I end up looking down and left slightly upon the arrow. This means that a straight line, were it drawn down the shaft of the arrow and out into space in front of me, would end up to the right and above my percieved target point, meaning of course that I should aim left, and lower, than my target if I desire to hit it. The more my hand is pushed out by my helm, the further left I need aim, and of course the lower I choose to lock, the lower I need aim.<br /><br />Adding further to this need to aim left, is the essential archers paradox. The arrow is being pushed forward in a straight line by the string, but lying in the way of this course is the bow itself. My a left-hander like myself, the arrow rests on the right side of the bow, and so it is pushed to the right by this effect. I am told that the amount by which the shaft can flex, and also the amount which the string twists when rolled off the fingers during release, can have an effect on the magnitude of this push to the right, but I cannot speak on this myself. Certainly it is pushed by the right by a measurable amount, which I judge very roughtly to be equivalent to shooting about a metre further to the right at fifty paces rance. <br /><br />To help compensate for this push to the right, I have been in the habit of tilting my bow somewhat so that it slants from left to right. This assists with keeping the arrow on my glove, and also converts some of this push to the right into a push upward. In thinking of this at late, I find myself somewhat concerned over the efficacy of this act. While upward aim is to be desired, in order to counteract the natural tendency of the arrow to fall, I can achieve any amount of upward aim I might wish simply by pointing by bow at a higher point. Instead, the goal must be at all times to reduce the number of variables while shooting. Tilting my bow is fine, if I can be sure that at all times I tilt it by the same amount. Sitting here writing my by candlelight, and not being outdoors with bow in hand, I cannot quite recall how much I tilt my bow, or if I can be certain that the amount is always constant. It does seem that the tilt is not as marked as was when I began my training, as perhaps I am not so nervous of losing an arrow of the glove. Methinks that next time I hold my bow, which hopefully shall not be too long hence, I shall try and hold it straight upward, as this does seem to me to be the one angle which I can best judge to always be the same. Then all the various forces dragging my need to aim all over the place shall in one more way be consistant, if still someone significant, and I might train myself better to understand them. Of course, if my arrow falls off, then I may need to rethink this course ere I end up shooting myself in the foot.<br /><br />The trick then is judging the magnitude of these forces which deviate the arrow from the point of aim at the current range. I cannot really judge my range in terms of numbers which I might relate to another, such as how many paces away my target might lie, but I have some sense of whether my target lies far or near compared to the ranges at which I often train. It is interesting to note, that in mathematical terms, three of the things which appear to displace my shot, being the push to the right by the bow, the apparent push to the right caused by the fact the arrow actually lies to the left of my eyes, and the apparent push dowards caused by the fact that the arrow lies below my eys, are all linear in nature compared to range. That is, at 20 yards, these things may each deviate my arrow by one metre from the apparent point of aim, and at 40 yards deviate it two metres.<br /><br />The force of gravity, however, is not linear but quadratic. The arrow falls at a rate proportional to the square of the distance. In fact, this may even be exacerbated by the slowing of the arrow in flight, causing it to appear faster towards the end of it\'s flight. Clearly it cannot actually fall faster, but if it were going slower it would travel less forward for each amount that it fell, giving much the same effect.<br /><br />This should mean that I must aim left and down from my target, by an ammount directly proportional to the range, and then raise my aim by an amount proportional to the square of the range. Proportional by how much is an aspect that much in need of practice, but the knowledge of the relative importance of these forces is of some interest, and may be usefull when next I train.','','2005-05-16 21:06:15');

For those who know it not, this sleepy little town  is not far east of the Arrowsreach heartlands, and it\'s open village green is a common spot for archers to hone their skills, either roving or at the butts. Many familiar faces greeted me there, including the lusty archers of the shire which I often meet on that same green, and also many of the other good folk of Arrowsreach and surrounds. Overall, the day had a very relaxing feel, with folk content to swap tales and eat simple country fare while enjoying the rare winter sun and the feats of arms performed on the field.<br /><br />After a warm up melee, a tourney was held with various men-at-arms demonstrating their skill with their chosen weapons. Great weapons seemed to be the order of the day, with several interesting fights taking place between wielders of two-handed swords. Victory was taken by Lord Sui Zo. <br /><br />On the archery field, a one one one tourney was held with victory going to Hanbal Reis al Barbary. Now, while Hanbal is a mighty fine warrior, it just wont do to have archery tourneys in Arrowsreach being won by folk from the neighbouring barony, so we\'ll have to see what can be done about this next time. While he had his harness on, Hanbal also showed off a bit with his crossbow and war-hammer, in order to convince the marshals that he makes a good heavy archer.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad way to spend an afternoon. I got to rub shoulders with many persons of quality, including folk from as far away as Cairnfell, work off my hangover from Stormhold\'s winterfeast the night before, and watch a bit of top notch biffing.

Last week, a boatload of raiders managed to slip up the river into the heartland of the Barony, inflicting some small damage on riverside hamlets.<br />  <br /> The raider\'s vicious inland strike was clearly targetted at the wealthy village of Auburn, only several hours march from their landing point, and the current location of Baronial tax collectors. Luckily for good burghers of Auburn, many Lords and Ladies of Stormhold had gathered for a tourney and picnic only a short ride away. Thus, when a bloody and exhausted peasant made the journey on foot to inform the Vicar of the bandit\'s landing, a force of the Barony\'s finest was ready to respond.<br />  <br /> Capably lead by Lord Hanbal Reis al Barbary, the defenders defeated the raiding forces, and prevented the capture of the Baronial taxes, despite being outnumbered. Casualties amongst the raiders were high, with the fighting coming fast and loose around the outskirts of Auburn. The raiders were mostly fast moving and lightly armed, relying heavily on archers, and although many arrows from both sides found their mark, the raiders proved unable to penetrate the solid defence put up by the valiant soldiers of Stormhold.</p><p><img border=\"0\" src=\"/image/file/13/archer3.jpg\" alt=\"Archer3\" /> <br /> </p>','','2005-08-14 16:09:57');

I am like you.<br /><br />I am not one of you.<br /><br />When I was two years old... no, younger, I\'ll explain that in a moment but when I was two years old I discovered accidentally that if I waved a shiny thing in front of my eyes it created a transparent 3d object that was mostly not there. You can do this with anything from a potato masher to a plastic comb, and I have, but anyway the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">importnat part</span> is that if you focus your eyes on a shiny 3d object that mostly isn\'t there, you can use this to enter a trance state. Like modern mediation classes will teach you to do with a candle flame.<br /><br />What does a two year old do with a meditative state?<br /><br />Can you imagine having everything you ever wanted? The only limits being your understanding of the universe and the lack of other minds in your own little world? Have you ever wanted your own little world to run and own as you please? I\'ve had this all my life. All of it. Anything I ever wanted, so long as I understood the underlying <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">system</span> required to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">simulate</span> it, I\'ve had it. I\'ve been everything. I might in fact be relatively uncorruptable because I\'ve had infinite power since I was a baby. There\'s a thought. I\'ve spent a certain, large, percentage of my life in an alternate state of conciousness. This has hampered my development in some areas, and done some really, really big things to it in others.<br /><br />Why the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">fuck</span> am I telling you this? What is a blog? It\'s an attempt at broadcast communication, to relate to the reader, and I have a bit of a problem relating to you because you haven\'t had an infinite number of your own worlds to do with as you please for as long as you can remember.<br /><br />Let\'s talk practical applications for a moment. Let\'s talk about the effect of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">practising system simulation</span> for a quarter of a century. Let\'s talk about looking at any system whatsoever and knowing how it works faster than anyone else possibly could, determining how it could be improved faster and more completely than anyone else, and being able to merge the improvements mentally (as a finished-product system and a migration-interim system) in an eyeblink. Completely. Before you\'re finished memorising the machine names, I have the new structure. I\'m saving the company 10k a year in my third week, but I don\'t own up to it yet because it\'s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">not credible<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> for a few more weeks.</span></span><br /><br />Any system. I was whirlpooled into IT by default, but I can also tell you how your brain works. [evolutionary advantage principle; every aspect of any evolved creature is a result of the environment in which it evolved]<br /><br />But let\'s talk about difference. Let\'s talk about a seven year old kid who couldn\'t possibly relate to other children, who could [the other children could] sense a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">difference,</span> not put their fingers on it but sense it nevertheless. Difference, to children, means inferiority. Difference, to me, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">had</span> to mean superiority. I literally didn\'t need friends. A seven year old\'s kids needs are actually pretty simple. Well, the feedback-loop needs. Socialising yourself doesnt occur to you at Seven. I could never simulate experience.<br /><br />+beer<br /><br />If this shit is vaguely interesting you\'re probably going to have to read it, forget it, come back later, read it again etc. I have no idea how much detail you need to see the pony. I don\'t explain this very often. This is my biggest secret. I think I\'ve told about 3 people before I told \'the world\'. anyway.<br /><br />I don\'t think that genetically speaking im massively intelligent. Dad was a wonderfully, wonderfully brilliant guy, and Mum has this excellent hidden intuitive intellgence that she hides with humility, but really, I\'m no einstein. But I see angles nobody else does, because my entire intelligence-learning structure is completely different and trained to examine systems and understand them. The most intellectual kinship I ever felt with anyone was with a guy who was born with massive brain damage (but an insanely high IQ). He said things the way I think them but never express them to another soul. Because I have learned to hide my <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">strangeness</span>.<br /><br />+beer<br /><br />Anyway. I promised I\'d tell you about \'younger than two\'. Basically, the last time I went home, Mum told me that I would lie awake as a baby, waving my hands above my face.<br /><br />...I don\'t know how far it goes back, if it can be taught to anyone, how much of an accident is it, if you clone me if it will happen again. etc. How would I know that? I can\'t simulate myself, no computer can.<br /><br />+beer<br /><br />I also promised I\'d talk about God. Now, almost any topic you can name I can give you an answer you hadn\'t come up with on, and you\'d hate that answer because I\'m inherently honest (to understand why, simulate dishonesty within any system for a few hours). Anyway, God.<br /><br />The first time I ever heard the voice of God, and I gotta put in here,  I can\'t tell you if it was God or some monstrous instinct in me simulating Him, was when I asked him to help a girl who was Anorexic.  I knew a bit about her story, its miserable. She was walking around, thin as a stick, on foot as I was and I crossed her at an old intersection I knew very well. Possibly The intersection of my life. anyway, as a christian sometimes does, I asked him in prayer to help her.<br /><br />His response was annihilative. There is no other word. He put me in touch, for one instant, with every. Single. Suffering. Human. On. the . Planet.<br /><br />There were the starving people in their millions, the sick poeple in their millions more. The parents, sitting on the ground in despair, watching their children starve, or die of preventable disease, or being shot. There was everything. The very thing hurting <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">you</span> in that moment, crushed my heart along with the six billion others. I cannot possibly describe what made me stagger, in tears, up the road. But the point is fairly plain. How can I ask for help for this one self-absorbed girl, with a world full of tragically dying people? I needed to put it in perspective. Haven\'t lost it since - it\'s hard to feel that even for one second and not dedicate the rest of your life to Saving The World.<br /><br />+beer<br /><br /><br />Oh god. anyway, I promised I\'d tell you about the Second Time too.<br /><br />This one was pure ego. I was depressed, drunk and walking around town. I found a bench overlooking a cliff overlooking the sea overlooking the moon rising. And He said unto me (God talks in silence. There is no sound, but a Divine Silence in which words appear in your mind which your mind identifies as coming from another source) he said &quot;When night falls, James, I raise the moon&quot;.<br /><br />Once again, blinding tears and whatnot. The *Feeling* associated with that statement was something like a creature who had lived for six billion years alone, waiting for another conscioussness to grow large enough to touch it. And had never - not even once - given up. I cannot even <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">begin</span></span> to describe the heroism of this. But the statement was basically &quot;I have never given up in all these billions of years, don\'t give up now&quot;<br /><br />I won\'t give up. I promise.<br /><br />But you guys. You\'re lying to yourselves and each other. you really are de-terraforming your planet via a carbon dioxide imbalance.

And guess what? If you drink enough water / plain juice / cordial / whatever afterwards, you wake up sans hangover. This is fact: half the reason you get hangovers is dehydration, and this can be counteracted by re-hydrating. The other half comes from the impurities, non-ethanol alcohols (EG methanol, a powerful carsenogen), preservatives and other assorted batshit the alcohol-corporations put in your drink. Pure alcohol plus rehydration post drinking = no hangover. You wake up the next morning feeling a little lethargic and very, very relaxed... but no headache, no nausea, no nothing.<br /><br />Of course if you try to do shots or mix it too strong, you will vomit uncontrollably. Your body isn\'t stupid: it knows when it\'s being poisoned. Put 2mm of this crap in a mug and set fire to it (use a long taper, it gets hot fast) and it will burn for several minutes, lighting a dark room with a pure blue flame, and leave almost no residue behind.<br /><br />Virgin kisses.

It\'s an excellent piece of writing. The author manages to convey his ideas simply and clearly, and without any waffle, leaving you with a very thin book indeed, but one without any fat. I read it in three hours, and I plan to be reading over large parts of it on a regular basis.</p><p>Kidwell\'s ideas are mainly based around sports psychology, and his experience as a bowhunter. I can\'t offer any opinions yet on how effective they are, but they certainly strike a cord with me, and I\'m keen to give them a shot.</p><br />','<p>So, no more lazing around and training with my bow once a fortnight (if I can make it). Starting today, there will be serious training for this archer, and it will be done according to the ideas in the book. Now, training regularly with a bow isn\'t terribly easy for me. I live in a small apartment, and a rented one at that. So this evening, I did the best I could, which consisted of hanging up a rubber backed picnic blanket in the carpark, in front of a brick wall so no one need be worried about me overshooting. Providing I don\'t hit too close to the top, the blanket takes the hit with nothing worse than a startlingly loud bang, as if I was beating a rug to get it clean (which, I suppose I am).</p> <p>Following the advice of my book, I decided to focus first on form. I already knew the importance of consistant form. Kidwell only really differs on this from other books I have read in a few areas:</p>  <ul> <li>He doesn\'t believe that your dominant eye makes any difference.</li><li>He isn\'t very proscriptive about what a <strong>good</strong> form actually is. He thinks that any method of shooting is pretty good, providing that it feels comfortable to you, you understand it, and can reproduce it consistantly.</li><li>He puts a lot of emphasis on the shot as a complete flow, rather than component parts. Specifically, he isn\'t in favour of time spent &quot;aiming&quot; with the bow fully drawn.</li><li>He talks about centering, which is a visualisation based technique used in many martial arts.</li> </ul><p>I considered this a bit while shooting. Kidwell talks a bit about different ways of focusing your attention on what you are doing, in order to best examine it. I\'m not sure I was really doing this very well, but some aspects of my form did seem fairly consistant. Here are some thoughts on how I shoot:</p> <ul>   <li>I shoot left handed. This was a conscious choice based on my dominant eye. It was initially a little wierd, but now I\'m better at it than the other, so there\'s no point switching, even if Kidwell thinks that the dominant eye isn\'t important.</li>   <li>When not wearing a helm, I anchor with my index finger at the corner of my mouth. This seems fine for me, given that I\'m a reasonably big lad, and only drawing a 28&quot; arrow.</li>   <li>I tend to want to spread my feet fairly far apart. Probably a bit too far. This seems to be mainly psychological. In planting my feet very firmly in a position of strength, rather than a more natural standing position, I am preparing for the shot. I do find that this limits me on the field, as it makes me feel a little like I can\'t hit anything if I don\'t take the time to get into such an exagerated pose. Therefore, I might try and reduce this a little.</li>   <li>I tend to focus on my upper back muscles a little as I draw. This is based on the accepted wisdom stating that drawing a bow should mainly come from the back, and not the arms. This is all well and good, but I probably shouldn\'t really be thinking about it so much anymore. A 30# bow isn\'t heavy for me, I have a very strong back (and arms), so I think I should spend more of the drawing time focusing on my target, and less on my muscles.</li>   <li>My nocking is better than it was, providing I nock underneath the nock point. I had real trouble yesterday using borrowed bows that nocked in different ways. <br />   </li>   <li>I\'m getting string slapped. It hurts. <br />   </li>   <li>I\'m not tilting forward terribly much, this is probably ok.</li>   <li>I am canting my bow a fair bit, a natural response to shooting off the hand. Instinctive archers tend to regard this as &quot;a good thing&quot;.</li>   <li>My release is fairly consistant, I\'m not seeing much in the way of dolphining as the arrow flies.</li>   <li>I just realised that I didn\'t really think about follow-through, although my targer was so close, I barely had time.</li> </ul> <p>I did a bit of practice in windage aiming too, but I\'m really running out of time to talk about that now, so I\'ll write more after tomorrows short practice session. I\'m not training long, maybe twenty minutes, but I want to do it really regularly, so we\'ll see how that goes.</p><p>Oh yeah, and I made a bag for my helm today, it just needs some drawstrings.<br /> </p>','2005-11-28 09:22:40');

On Confederation worlds, types of faith vary in accordance with the ethnic origin of the population. After the unrest experienced on the initial multiethnic colonies, subsequent colonies (post-2130) tended to derive their population from just one ethnic or religious group, thus giving the majority of Confederation planets a single religion, and adherence to it is often an immigration requirement. Sacred cities and shrines such as the Vatican, Mecca, Amaterasu, and Mt Abu remain the centres of their respective faiths. </td><td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"><small><b>Ol\' Time Religion</b><br />The distribution of the devout in Adamist society has not really changed in almost 600 years.

Religious divides still cause more hardship than can be reasonably justified, and there are as many who view Edenism with jelousy as disgust. However, while there are many Adamist who would like to partake in the benefits of their genetic courage, more than 90% of those still have grave misgivings regarding the subsumption of individuality. And no amount of testimonials from Edenists or their newest citizens seems to be able to make a difference. Call it a triumph of religious marketing, or a topic as yet adequately addressed from the Edenists they so badly fear, but until the issue is resolved, the rift will not get any smaller. The more powerful Edenists new powers grow, the more those in power in Adamist society (and this includes religious leaders to a large degree) will be suspicious of any overtures of fellowship. </small></td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">Christian evangelical movements and Islamic fundamentalism have declined to negligible proportions; both of these religions have mellowed considerably since the twentieth century, especially among their followers on Earth, and there is even speculation on an eventual total unity, although this must still be several centuries distant. </td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">Of more immediate concern to current religious leaders is the declining numbers of the faithful. The impact of a technological society on the tenets of basic faith has never let up. At the start of the twenty-seventh century, less than 5 per cent of the population now attends regular worship.

Also contributing to this enhanced mental health is the communal use of Farsense which allows an Edenist to share and therefore mitigate any personal stress and worry.

Edenists do not necessarily transfer their personalities in the habitat where they were born, only where they die.

The name derives from the biblical Adam, who was first and therefore untainted. It was also an obvious choice, given that those who possessed an affinity gene were principally living in the habitat Eden at the time (2090) when the two cultures began to diverge (A Second Chance at Eden). In general, Adamists live on colonized terracompatible planets and in asteroid settlements. A small number live in the five independent (non-Edenist) bitek habitats.\r\n				</TD>\r\n\r\n			<TR>\r\n				<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n					Thanks to genetic engineering (geneering), average Adamist life expectancy is approximately 115 years, though this can vary wildly. Most Adamists are now the recipients of geneering performed between 2050 and 2200, with descendants of European, North American, and Pacific Rim nations benefiting from the highest level of enhancements. There are three Confederation planets which are settled entirely by humans who have no genetic manipulation in their ancestry, all of which have pastoral- or religious-based constitutions. Some enclaves of \'pure\' humans also live on other worlds, though their numbers are now in decline due to constant contact with their geneered cousins. Most of those groups were founded on religious or ethical grounds. Although isolated during the first stages of colonization, such separatism from a planet\'s mainstream culture is difficult to maintain. After learning of the outside world, the children of such groups normally find it very hard to understand why their ancestors have denied them this beneficial genetic heritage, and they tend to drift away from their enclaves. With most hereditary diseases eradicated, organ efficiency improved, and substantial enhancement to the immune system, there is little need for geneering to be performed on foetuses now. The type of geneering which is still researched and practised is concentrated principally on extending life expectancy. Among the very rich there is a fashion for having cosmetic geneering performed on their children; not just for classical beauty, but for blending of distinct racial traits, e.g. combining red hair with black skin.\r\n				</TD>\r\n			</TR>\r\n\r\n			<TR>\r\n				<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n					The main exception to this slowdown of basic physiological alteration is the Royal Saldana family, whose members are still being modified for increased intelligence and memory capacity, and reduced sleep requirement, as well as expanding their life expectancy, which currently stands at 180 years. In short they are (ironically) becoming close to the Edenist ideal, lacking only affinity.\r\n				</TD>\r\n			\r\n				<TD ROWSPAN=\"5\" VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n					<small>\r\n						<b>Friends and Neighbours</b><br>It is vital that one does not underestimate the antipathy  towards Edenism that exists at the upper levels of power in Adamist culture. What began as a violation of God\'s gift to us has since evolved into what is most often called \"The Power That Corrupts\". Edenists see their Metabilies as fundamental parts of themselves, and the commonly held belief is that these powers would have manifest in our race eventually. Edenists just accelerated the process. Obviously this argument does nothing to placate their Adamist opponents.\r\n					</small>\r\n				</TD>\r\n				\r\n			<TR>\r\n				<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n					The second exception is the starship owner-operator families (such as the Calverts), who undergo dominant-gene modifications to cope with the long periods of zero-gee on their ships (again similar to that of Edenists). These families have eliminated vertiginous disorientation and organ decay, while bone-calcium levels will not decrease in the absence of gravity. Internal membranes are strengthened to cope with periods of high-gee acceleration (a function which is more commonly augmented with nanonic membranes), thus preventing organs from tearing, and their heart capacity has been increased to ensure their blood supply remains regular under acceleration.\r\n				</TD>\r\n			</TR>\r\n\r\n				\r\n			<TR>\r\n				<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n					Adamists, however, remain totally opposed to using the affinity bond (see below for exceptions). Although it began as a mild disagreement between users and non-users to start with (2050-2090), this attitude is now irrevocably entrenched among them, and has become the symbolic difference between the two principal human cultures. Because of its association with bitek (which it was originally designed to control), this affinity-bond technology has also been virtually abandoned by Adamists. Both Islam and the Christian Unity Church have proscribed the affinity gene as inhuman. The rationale is that the affinity gene is not part of the genetic heritage which was given to us by God, but instead was artificially designed and has to be sequenced into a foetus\'s DNA.\r\n				</TD>\r\n			</TR>\r\n\r\n			<TR>\r\n				<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n					Geneering, which is the alteration (the more devout say \'tampering with\') of existing genes, is permissible (principally because it brought so many medical benefits to the masses that it became impossible for non- fundamentalist Churches to oppose it). Shinto, Buddhism, and Hinduism are not so vigorous in their condemnation; affinity-bond domination of animals, or human communion, is not forbidden but it is frowned upon.

Over the years it evolved into Farsense, while the other Metabilities slowly came to more and more prominence. There have been a few individuals who would rate as very powerful in the last few hundred years, but out of Edenism\'s entire population, these most powerful Operants number as few as ten. Bitek habitats are sentient and Operant to varying degrees, although they are all much more powerful than the average Edenist. A bitek habitat can receive from and communicate with other habitats, bitek organisms, and Edenists over a great range.\r\n				</TD>\r\n			</TR>\r\n\r\n			<TR>\r\n				<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n					With 4,250 mature habitats orbiting Jupiter, these provide an Farsense zone, or relay, across the whole Jovian moon system.

Wing-Tsit Chong contributed to the project by developing the habitat\'s thought routines, and by modifying affinity to provide a communal affinity symbiont allowing everyone to converse with both the habitat and each other. He then went on to incorporate the affinity neural architecture into a gene sequence which could be spliced into a foetus, giving a child the same ability from birth. Those children were the first to grow up in this unique environment, sharing their thoughts with each other and with Eden.

First of course was Farsensing, a more refined version of the original Affinity.

Eden then declared independence from the JSKP (see A Second Chance at Eden). A similar Islamic proclamation followed swiftly. Pope Eleanor also threatened to excommunicate anyone using symbiont neurons. In the five years following, all the remaining people possessing the affinity gene or symbionts (Christian or otherwise) emigrated to Eden and Pallas. After this, the use of the affinity symbionts and bonded domestic servitor animals died out on Earth. Bitek organisms were also abandoned, leaving bitek as an almost exclusively Edenist technology. By 2110 the dividing line between the two human cultures was fully established.\r\n				</TD>\r\n			</TR>\r\n\r\n			<TR>\r\n				<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n					While it began as a way to provide easy communication, affinity has evolved far beyond Wing-Tsit Chong\'s original design.

Also their bodies are immune to zerogee atrophy: bones do not waste, blood-cell balance remains unchanged, alterations to veins and capillaries and arteries prevent the pooling of blood in the head, taste and smell are retained at near full sensitivity. This faculty causes them to regard both the boosted and cosmoniks (there are no Edenist cosmoniks) with some pity. The descendants of the hundred families from whom voidhawk crews are traditionally drawn have taken their modification a stage further than the Edenist norm. Their internal membranes are strengthened to hold organs in place during high-gee acceleration, and heart efficiency has been increased to ensure that a regular blood supply is maintained, thus preventing blackouts; they are capable of enduring three gees for days at a time, although this still does not bring them level with the tolerance of boosted blackhawk crews (see Blackhawks, page XXX). The second largest area of Edenist genetic research is currently concentrated on giving humanity a body immunity to radiation exposure, or at least the ability to recover from it. Although highly resistant to ordinary varieties of cancer, Edenists exposed to high levels of radiation in space remain susceptible to it.

It is \r\n		a subtle miss-use of exceptions.\r\n	</p>\r\n	<pre>\r\npublic int GetInteger(XmlNode xmlNode) \r\n{ \r\n	if (xmlNode != null) \r\n	{ \r\n		try \r\n		{ \r\n			return Convert.ToInt32(xmlNode.InnerText, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); \r\n		} \r\n		catch (Exception) \r\n		{ \r\n			return 0; \r\n		} \r\n	} \r\n	else \r\n	{ \r\n		return 0; \r\n	} \r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n	<p>\r\n		There are a couple of problems with the code. Firstly the catch is catching all \r\n		exceptions and silently swallowing them.\r\n	</p>\r\n	<p><b>Rule1 : Only catch the exceptions you are interested in. </b>\r\n	</p>\r\n	<p>Secondly and far more importantly, standard use of this method relies on \r\n		exceptions being thrown and caught. In one example the method is called with a \r\n		valid value for of ‘UNL’ for unlimited. An exception is therefore thrown in a \r\n		situation that is not _exceptional_. A symptom of this problem is that if \r\n		unexpected or currupt data is read in then the error will be hidden behind a \r\n		default value.</p>\r\n	<p><b>Rule2 : Only allow exceptions to be thrown in exceptional circumstances.</b> I \r\n		would take this a step further. In Visual studio you can make the debugger \r\n		break on an exception being thrown. You should be able to turn this on and run \r\n		your application without it breaking once during normal use of your \r\n		application. If you can\'t do this, then there is some code that is relying on \r\n		exceptions being thrown to perform logic. These cases should be replaced with a \r\n		method to verify the state of the system before the exception-raising call is \r\n		made to ensure the exceptional situation has already been handled.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		So... a better solution to the above code would be to check for the allowable \r\n		‘UNL’ value and handle it correctly, before passing the other values onto the \r\n		convert method. The convert method should not hide the exception, but either \r\n		bubble it up, or better re-throw a new exception with more context.\r\n	</p>\r\n	<p>It is starting to sound like no method is needed for this as each situation will \r\n		be diffrent. If you insist of writing one though, I guess it would be something \r\n		like this.</p>\r\n	<pre>\r\npublic int InterpretAsInteger(XmlNode xmlNode, AllowableValues values) \r\n{\r\n	if (xmlNode == null) \r\n	{\r\n		return values.Interpret(null); \r\n	}\r\n	\r\n	if (values.CanInterpret(xmlNode.InnerText))\r\n	{\r\n		return values.Interpret(xmlNode.InnerText);\r\n	}\r\n	\r\n	try \r\n	{ \r\n		return Convert.ToInt32(xmlNode.InnerText, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); \r\n	} \r\n	catch (InvalidCaseException ex) \r\n	{ \r\n		throw new XmlNodeInterpretationException(string.Format(\"\'{0}\' could not be converted to an Integer\",xmlNode.InnderText),ex);\r\n	}\r\n}\r\n	</pre>\r\n	<p>\r\n		All allowable values are stored in the AllowableValues class. It also stored \r\n		what to return for Null. All other values are converted to integers. In the \r\n		case of an exception the context in maintained. In the case of an unexpeted typ \r\n		of exception it will bubble up and become visible.\r\n	</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		I found that analyzing this code helped me clarify in my head when exceptions \r\n		should and shouldn’t be used, so I though I would share it.\r\n	</p>\r\n</span>\r\n<!-- \r\n	New Blog \r\n-->\r\n<span class=\"rss:item\">\r\n	<p><strong>Software is never finished</strong>\r\n	</p>\r\n	<p>In an article about <a href=\"http://www.superfactory.com/articles/lean_office.aspx\">\'lean \r\n			manufacturing\'</a> there is a comment that made me think.

You can also \r\n		exercise the controls in the form with commands like \"Press button with the \r\n		text of \'Add\'\".

The gist of the quote was that \r\n		touching code, no matter how wonderful it makes future efforts, brings risk to \r\n		a project lifecycle that did not schedule it.</p>\r\n	<p>Steven McConnell is right to say changing code is risky. It\'s like walking a \r\n		long balance beam. To be sure to stay on the beam progress has to be slow, and \r\n		meticulous. If you make a mistake you get feedback in the form of the floor \r\n		making its presents felt. The longer the time between creating the error and \r\n		getting the feedback, the more it hurts. The solution is to reduce the time \r\n		between creating the error and gaining the feedback. Lower the beam so it is \r\n		only an inch from the floor. Once you have done this, there is far less risk, \r\n		and you no longer have to make slow progress. Suddenly you are free to run \r\n		along the beam, knowing if you fall, you can always get back on again. You gain \r\n		confidence and courage.</p>\r\n	<p>In development the feedback is in the form of testing. The shorter the time is \r\n		between writing the bug and detecting it, the less it costs to fix.</p>\r\n	<p>Acceptance testing your applicaion, and having a good QA team are great. However \r\n		the bar is still a meter or two from the floor. By putting in place a suite of \r\n		fully automated unit tests, and running them after every code change, you are \r\n		able to catch unwanted changes to functionality as soon as they are made. As a \r\n		result you are able to develop at a much faster rate, and make large changes to \r\n		the code-base with minimal risk.\r\n	</p>\r\n</span>\r\n<!-- \r\n	New Blog \r\n-->\r\n<span class=\"rss:item\">\r\n	<p><strong>Resharper Rocks!

These sites are dynamic because you can edit them online and provide interesting and up to date content, so that people will visit again and again. Portallus isn\'t the first system to do this, nor will it be the last.</p><p>So why then would you consider using Portallus for your website?<br /></p><h4>1. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">It\'s Dead Easy</span><br /></h4><p>Anyone can make a site with Portallus. Even your mum could do it. You don\'t need any special software, you don\'t need to know about web hosting, web design, HTML documents, uploading files, or anything. You just click a button and your site is created. Click another button and you can add a page to your site. Click again and you can edit the page straight away with the web browser you are using now. We handle things like menus, and layout, you just get your info on the web with the minimum of fuss.<br /></p><h4>2. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">It\'s Going Places</span><br /></h4><p>Portallus development is proceeding at a rapid pace, and we\'ve got big ideas. Perhaps you want to add something other than plain pages to your site? That will happen. Very soon, you\'ll be able to add journals (or blogs), calendars, discussion forums, and all sorts of great features that you normally only see on professional web sites, installed by professional computer geeks. Portallus makes it usable by regular people, and will still provide all the features to keep the geeks happy, like RSS and Atom syndication, custom templates, and third party plugins.<br /></p><p>In addition to all these web portal features, Portallus is about Social Networking. By version 0.3, Portallus will have the first of a rich set of features aimed to let you interact with other people\'s websites, make connections with friends, join groups, and stay up to date with other sites automatically. We plan to support open standards, such as <a href=\"http://www.foaf-project.org/\">FOAF</a>, to ensure that you can interact with people using other social networking systems.<br /></p><h4>2. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">It\'s Not Evil<br /></span></h4><p>After the imminent release of version 0.2, Portallus will become a democratic community project, developed using a co-operative business model and released free as <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/\">Open Source</a> software. We, the Portallus developers, still hope to make a living developing this product. If we couldn\'t do that, then we wouldn\'t be able to still develop it for you. However, we think that we can do that, while still alowing a fair go to anyone else who wants to join in, build on our ideas, or interact with our software. Also, one of the advantages of Open Source projects like this is that even if the current developers all got run over by herds of stampeding elephants tomorrow, other developers would still be free to carry on the project if they wished.<br /></p><p><br /></p>\n\n</div>\n');

At early levels you are able to understand the basic inner workings of any organic form, while the more adept and advanced are able to gain a keen insight into the way in which that being interacts with the greater Life Sphere that surrounds it.\r\n			</p>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   Note- Does NOT require the Skill \"MEDICINE\". \"Bio Scan\" allows the redactor to understand a person\'s physical ailments at a psychic level.\r\n			</p>\r\n	\r\n		<h3>Healing Hands</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   This is the classic \"Laying of Hands\", and is one of the first healing feats taught to the early Operant Redactor. The healer places their hands over the damaged area, and their mind\'s energies serve to sooth the pain of any small to medium trauma to some degree. It does not actually heal, but it does go some way to preventing a patient from going into shock.\r\n			</p>\r\n	\r\n		<h3>Deep Probe</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   A patient\'s mind is an open book to you. With their permission, you can delve into the deepest parts of their mind, unveiling the things they keep secret, even from themselves.\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Redactive Probe</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   This is a type of mental probe which allows the Redactor to look deep into a person\'s mind. This type of probe is a very subtle one, and uses a combination of psychological stimuli and Redactive healing techniques to move deeply and cleanly into the patient\'s mind. If it done with enough subtlety, it can be completely undetectable, with the patient only being aware of the conscious stimuli being applied. Redactive probes are particularly effective when used in conjunction with a Coercive element, and is heavily influenced by the patient\'s state of mind. The more agitated the patient, the more difficult this type of probe is to use effectively.\r\n			</p>\r\n\r\n		<h3>Diagnose Physical Ailment</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   This ranges from knowing what kind of fracture a person has to being able to identify which strain of Herpes a person is suffering from.\r\n			</p>\r\n		\r\n		<h3>Diagnose Mental Ailment</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   xxx\r\n			</p>\r\n		\r\n		<h3>Treat Physical Ailment</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   Low levels allow the healing of Light Wounds, at a rate of 1 Hit per level per hour.\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Treat Mental Ailment</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   At low levels the Redactor is able to ease the symptomatic suffering of a patient, releasing a mental \"balm\" which sooths overt suffering. The operator is not able to treat the causes of genuine mental trauma until they are much more adept.\r\n			</p>\r\n			<p>\r\n			Note- Requires Diagnose Mental Ailment or Group Heal at the same level.\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Mind Ream</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   This is the most alarming use of the Redactor\'s powers. It involves using a Redactive Probe to invade the subject\'s mind, which is then followed by the Redactor reading the entire contents of that mind. It is extremely distressing to the subject as they are forced to review every iota of their own lives and memories with painful clarity. Most subjects are left virtually mindless, as their mind shuts down in defence. Some skill is required to prevent this from happening too early, robbing the Redactor of the information they were attempting to uncover.\r\nThe patient is able to use their own willpower to resist this, though it is seldom successful for more than a few minutes. Under controlled conditions, and with the right drugs, this is almost unstoppable.\r\n\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Diagnose Physical Self</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   Almost all Redactors are able to do this to some extent, and the skill is quite easily taught. (Half XP cost)\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Diagnose Mental Self</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   This is one of the hardest Redactive skills there is. In fact, to date there has only been one healer with a verified ability to perform this, and the skill was lost when she died several years ago. (10x XP cost)\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Treat Self</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   You are able to heal yourself at an accelerated rate. The ailments you are able to deal with depend on your level in this skill, as does the rate of acceleration.\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Inner Glow</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   You never suffer from the minor diseases which plague our race. If you are exposed to a minor virus or bug, you are able to ward it off with little or no effort.\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Group Heal</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   This training is required before a person is able to participate in a group-healing attempt. (System- each participant\'s \"group heal\" level is added together, the total subtracting from the difficulty of the heal)\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Use Skin</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   The \"Skin\" is a genetically neural dermal organ which grafts itself onto any organic matter it is placed onto. Once there, it begins to adapt itself to the organ, becoming a healthy exterior, which then becomes a solid basis from which to heal. It is particularly effective against all kinds of skin wounds, including mild Melanoma. With the assistance of a powerful Redactor, the skin can be up to five times more effective, healing and then being absorbed and metabolised by the body at an almost miraculous rate.\r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Use Exo-Womb</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   A skin tank is a device grown from a modified human womb. It is most often used for deep organ trauma, though it can also be employed to perform a complete physical rejuvenation. It can re-grow missing limbs, and even re-assemble severely damaged brain tissue, though the results are not always entirely similar to the original brain before the accident.\r\n			</p>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   It is a large, cylindrical organic construct, and one of the ugliest things you will ever see. The Redactor uses their own powers to energize the construct, and helps it adjust to new patients. This requires months of training, and to fail in this attempt results in the tank rejecting the patient. This is often fatal, so groups of Redactors are used in these initial stages to ensure the safety of the patient. \r\n			</p>\r\n			\r\n		<h3>Mitigate</h3>\r\n			<p>\r\n			   This is used by frequent interstellar travellers to deal with the pain of faster than light travel. The pain can never be truly ignored, but this allows the traveller to deal with it and remain in control of their faculties.\r\n			</p>\r\n		\r\n\r\n	<P>\r\nThere are many more skills yet to be documented.\r\n</p>\r\n');

Skin is usually exchanged for a hard, dark, polymer layer resembling thick leather enabling them to step directly into a vacuum or radiation environment without any other preparation or protection, though hard exoskeleton-type casing can also be used. Many have modified their basic humanoid structure, equipping their feet with gripping claws, giving themselves three forearms each with a specialist tool hand, etc. Most starships carry one or two cosmoniks as crew-members.

If missed, you lose one level on one random attribute. If one attribute reaches level Non-Existent (-4), you die. Roll every 6 month after 90yo (70yo in reality) and every 3 month after 110yo (90yo in reality). </li><li><strong>Movement</strong>: Your base, walking speed is <strong>3.5+(Strength+Agility)/4</strong> meters per 3-second turn. (e.g. a Good Strength and Superb Agility give 4.5m/turn, i.e. 1,5m/s, i.e. 5.4 km/h). You can run up to 6 times your walking speed, i.e. Speed Level 6. (e.g. 6 x 4.5m/turn, i.e. 9m/s, you run 100m in 11.1 sec). Usually you can only change your Speed Level by +/- 3 maximum in one turn. Check the following table for speed level equivalent in m/turn, m/second, km/h, function of Strength+Agility. <p /><center><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><th>Speed Level</th><th colspan=\"3\">1</th><th colspan=\"3\">1,5</th><th colspan=\"3\">2</th><th colspan=\"3\">3</th><th colspan=\"3\">4</th><th colspan=\"3\">5</th><th colspan=\"3\">6</th></tr><tr><th>Agi+Str</th><td>m/t</td><td>m/s</td><td>km/h</td><td>m/t</td><td>m/s</td><td>km/h</td><td>m/t</td><td>m/s</td><td>km/h</td><td>m/t</td><td>m/s</td><td>km/h</td><td>m/t</td><td>m/s</td><td>km/h</td><td>m/t</td><td>m/s</td><td>km/h</td><td>m/t</td><td>m/s</td><td>km/h</td></tr><tr><th>-6</th><td>2,0</td><td>0,7</td><td>2,4</td><td>3,0</td><td>1,0</td><td>3,6</td><td>4,0</td><td>1,3</td><td>4,8</td><td>6,0</td><td>2,0</td><td>7,2</td><td>8,0</td><td>2,7</td><td>9,6</td><td>10</td><td>3,3</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>4,0</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><th>-5</th><td>2,3</td><td>0,8</td><td>2,7</td><td>3,4</td><td>1,1</td><td>4,1</td><td>4,5</td><td>1,5</td><td>5,4</td><td>6,8</td><td>2,3</td><td>8,1</td><td>9,0</td><td>3,0</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>3,8</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>4,5</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><th>-4</th><td>2,5</td><td>0,8</td><td>3,0</td><td>3,8</td><td>1,3</td><td>4,5</td><td>5,0</td><td>1,7</td><td>6,0</td><td>7,5</td><td>2,5</td><td>9,0</td><td>10</td><td>3,3</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>4,2</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>5,0</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>-3</th><td>2,8</td><td>0,9</td><td>3,3</td><td>4,1</td><td>1,4</td><td>5,0</td><td>5,5</td><td>1,8</td><td>6,6</td><td>8,3</td><td>2,8</td><td>9,9</td><td>11</td><td>3,7</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>4,6</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>5,5</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>-2</th><td>3,0</td><td>1,0</td><td>3,6</td><td>4,5</td><td>1,5</td><td>5,4</td><td>6,0</td><td>2,0</td><td>7,2</td><td>9,0</td><td>3,0</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>4,0</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>5,0</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>6,0</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><th>-1</th><td>3,3</td><td>1,1</td><td>3,9</td><td>4,9</td><td>1,6</td><td>5,9</td><td>6,5</td><td>2,2</td><td>7,8</td><td>9,8</td><td>3,3</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>4,3</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>5,4</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>6,5</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><th>0</th><td>3,5</td><td>1,2</td><td>4,2</td><td>5,3</td><td>1,8</td><td>6,3</td><td>7,0</td><td>2,3</td><td>8,4</td><td>11</td><td>3,5</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>4,7</td><td>17</td><td>18</td><td>5,8</td><td>21</td><td>21</td><td>7,0</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><th>1</th><td>3,8</td><td>1,3</td><td>4,5</td><td>5,6</td><td>1,9</td><td>6,8</td><td>7,5</td><td>2,5</td><td>9,0</td><td>11</td><td>3,8</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>5,0</td><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>6,3</td><td>23</td><td>23</td><td>7,5</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>4,0</td><td>1,3</td><td>4,8</td><td>6,0</td><td>2,0</td><td>7,2</td><td>8,0</td><td>2,7</td><td>9,6</td><td>12</td><td>4,0</td><td>14</td><td>16</td><td>5,3</td><td>19</td><td>20</td><td>6,7</td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>8,0</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>4,3</td><td>1,4</td><td>5,1</td><td>6,4</td><td>2,1</td><td>7,7</td><td>8,5</td><td>2,8</td><td>10</td><td>13</td><td>4,3</td><td>15</td><td>17</td><td>5,7</td><td>20</td><td>21</td><td>7,1</td><td>26</td><td>26</td><td>8,5</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><th>4</th><td>4,5</td><td>1,5</td><td>5,4</td><td>6,8</td><td>2,3</td><td>8,1</td><td>9,0</td><td>3,0</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>4,5</td><td>16</td><td>18</td><td>6,0</td><td>22</td><td>23</td><td>7,5</td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>9,0</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><th>5</th><td>4,8</td><td>1,6</td><td>5,7</td><td>7,1</td><td>2,4</td><td>8,6</td><td>9,5</td><td>3,2</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>4,8</td><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>6,3</td><td>23</td><td>24</td><td>7,9</td><td>29</td><td>29</td><td>9,5</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><th>6</th><td>5,0</td><td>1,7</td><td>6,0</td><td>7,5</td><td>2,5</td><td>9,0</td><td>10</td><td>3,3</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>5,0</td><td>18</td><td>20</td><td>6,7</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>8,3</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>10</td><td>36</td></tr></tbody></table></center></li></ul><div align=\"left\">If your speed level is A ( speed = A x walking speed), you take one &quot;Out of Breath&quot;

Note that I ruled out the &quot;5-point Fudge&quot; approach because of the complexity of 2100-era characters, where it\'s in my view very difficult to define broad types of competences. </p><p>The number of points available to create characters may vary depending on GM\'s decision. After converting GTHS NPCs to FTHS I saw that GURPS 100-pts characters are valued around 100 fudge creation points, so the range of FTHS characters is the same as in GTHS. I advise to give 200 creation points to create 200 GURPS pts-like characters. The GM can also impose some limitations in character creation, like the maximum number of points to be used in Gifts (I would suggest 5 gifts, or 50 points), or the maximum number of &quot;Great&quot; and &quot;Superb&quot; skills (I would suggest: 3 &quot;Great&quot; and 0 &quot;Superb&quot;). </p><p>Racial Gifts &amp; Faults are in general linked to a Racial Template (Upgrade, Bioroid, etc...). See <a href=\"#4_2-SampleChar\">Templates</a> for a partial list of converted Templates, and refer to the GTHS books. But the GM or the player can also imagine other racial templates, new versions, etc... </p><p>Points are assigned using the following rules: </p><ul><li><b>Attributes</b> have a default value of Fair, except when modified by Gifts or Faults. Change of one level represent 5 points (i.e. it cost 5 points to move an Attribute up one level, and you gain 15 points to moving it down one level). Accepted deviation from default value is -3 to +3. </li><li><b>Size</b> is normally 0 for Humanoid. Size is normally used for non-humanoid characters (animals, monsters, etc...). Each Size level is valued 10 points. </li><li><b>Skills</b> have a default value of Terrible when they are Normal, Non-Existent (Terrible-1) when they are Hard, Poor when they are Easy, and Fair when they are &quot;Natural&quot; (i.e. when a &quot;Natural Skill&quot; racial gift is taken). Moving a skill up one level cost 2 points up to Fair, then 4 points from Fair to Good, 8 points from Good to Great, 16 points from Great to Superb (Note that this rule is also the same during the game, for progression through experience points).

Damage is moderated by Stamina</li></ul><p><b>Simplified Creation</b>: For more simplicity, divide the number of available points by 10 (e.g. 20pts for 200pts characters).

INSERT INTO `pages` VALUES (168,222,'<p>Normal vehicle driving, either by manual controls or operated by AI, is not difficult even with a Poor driving skill; any obstacles or delicate situation can be dealt with by slowing down and taking your time. Problems arise when speed comes into the picture: chasing or being chased, running against the clock, etc. </p><p>I advise the use of an abstract system for vehicles, without markers or anything, partly because physical representation is cumbersome and slows down the game, partly because moving vehicles on a map and choosing speed &amp; turns requires real tactical skill from the player, which may not necessarily reflect the skill level of the character or its aids (AIs). </p><p>The core idea of this abstract system is to determine a Drive Performance each turn, by adding up elements from the vehicle attributes, external condtions, and the level of risk taken by each driver. The higher Drive Performance wins the round and can decide what it will do. The GM can however describe the action and the environment to the players, letting them choose tactical options and risks levels, and interpreting results action-wise. The probability of a Crash is only linked to the level of risk taken by the drivers, but the consequences are higher if the external conditions are difficult. </p><p>First of all the GM should determine the objectives of each opponent. A <b>Chase</b> occurs when one opponent tries to run away, and the other tries to catch him. If both opponents run away, there is no Chase; if both opponents want to stop the other car, there is no chase either, they just stop a few meters away. In a Chase, the <b>Catcher</b> usually starts behind the Prey, and usually tries to <b>Close</b> the distance with his Prey in order to <b>Fire</b> weapons (from a gunner, or from a turret, or from a fixed point), or to <b>Ram</b> the Prey, or to <b>Block</b> its way. The <b>Prey</b> usually tries to <b>Break-Off</b>, or to <b>Loose</b> the Catcher, or to <b>Fire</b> back, or even to <b>Ram</b> the catcher if he tries to Block him. All is conditionned by the distance between the Prey and the Catcher. </p><p>The <b>Distance</b> is measured in <b>Combat Turns</b>, i.e. 3 seconds. A distance of 1 turn means around 25m if both vehicle have a speed of 30 km/h (20 mph), 40m at 50 km/h (30 mph), 80m at 100 km/h (60 mph), 160m at 200 km/h (120 mph). A chase usually starts with the two vehicles separated by 3 combat turns (around 10 seconds, or 150m in a city...). Combat Turn is also used to position External Elements in the chase, like: &quot;There is a street to the left in 2 combat turns&quot;, or &quot;Watch-out, Pedestrian Crossing in 3 combat turns !&quot;. When Opponents are separated by one or more Combat Turns, the External Elements are reached at different times by the two opponents: e.g. there is a street to the left in 2 combat turns for the Prey, and the Catcher is 2 combat turns behind the Prey; the Prey will reach the street to the left in 2 combat turns, and the Catcher in 4 combat turns, provided he doesn\'t Close the distance. Combat Turns also indicates for how long the Line-Of-Sight is broken when the Prey turns into a street; The Catcher must wait as many turns as the distances between him and the Prey (including this turn) before having a clear Line-Of-Sight allowing him to fire. </p>');

INSERT INTO `pages` VALUES (176,232,'<p>These implants are really a re-weaving of a person’s existing muscular structure. Nano-scale robots are injected into a person’s body and programmed with their specific responsibilities.<br />Muscle modification ranges from simple density increasing to complete replacement. With each type of strength increase comes a corresponding increase in speed. However there is a downside. These new muscles have to draw their strength from some energy source. Where this energy comes from depends on the type of boosting.</p><blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\"><p><strong>Increased Muscle Density-<br /></strong>These muscles work exactly like normal human muscles, however they give a person the strength of a comparatively sized Ape. Due to the massive amounts of energy they use all the time, people who buy this kind of boosting find that their food intake requirements dramatically increase in order to keep their muscles fed. They tend to eat about a.5 times their normal amount per meal. Most of the time this isn’t a problem, but if food becomes scarce they’ll quickly begin to loose energy.<br />These adapted muscles heal at the same rate as they did before.<br />Muscle power is increased from 150% to 300%, depending on cost.<br /><strong>Muscle Assist Implants-</strong><br />These are surgically implanted sacs of nanonic tissue that work in concert with ones normal muscles. They take their energy from the bioelectric energy of the person. Again, this increases the food intake.<br />They are more resistant to most forms of damage, though when injured these implants must be treated by a combination of surgical and cybernetic techniques by a skilled physician. Once a damaged implant is repaired (or replaced) the surrounding muscles heal normally. Should the surrounding muscles be allowed to heal without first repairing the damaged implants, the implants will severely impair the performance of the person in their day to day lives.<br />Muscle power is increased from 110% to 300%, though anything over 150% is clearly visible as boosted muscle.<br /><strong>Complete Muscle Replacement-</strong><br />As the name suggests, the muscles are removed and replaced with complete cybernetic systems. Support systems generate the required power from bioelectric energy, again requiring greater food intake. These new muscles are generally the same size and weight as the original, though their power is increased from 200% to 500% of the original muscles.</p></blockquote><p />');
INSERT INTO `pages` VALUES (177,233,'<p>Sensory enhancement can be divided into two basic categories- Hardware and Software. Hardware involves organ replacement allowing for better receptors able to deal with a broader bandwidth of data. Software is the tools used to process and integrate that data. All 5 senses can be enhanced to quite ridiculous degrees these days. The reasons for enhancement vary from person to person, but almost every Adamist has some kind of basic sensory adaptation done, even if it’s just a set of Level Clamps to prevent overloading due to aggressively high input.

INSERT INTO `pages` VALUES (178,234,'<p>This is the most commonly installed enhancement, and if done it usually involves total optical replacement.

They need not fit the standard human facial design, though most find this design a good position to stick with as it does allow trouble free social interaction. Options available include-<br /><strong>Greater Visual Bandwidth-</strong> seeing ultra-violet and infrared. Very useful in space industries and combat tracking situations.<br /><strong>Zoom / Macro-</strong> Zoom factors of 1000x are possible, though any more has to be done is software with the unavoidable image quality loss. Macro can go down to about 0.01. Any more requires dedicated hardware like a microscope.<br /><strong>Low Light-</strong> Standard blue/green overlay of available light. Works really well.<br /><strong>Glare Proofing-</strong> This clamps any incoming signal in hardware before it gets a chance to fry any of the receptors after it. This unit actually does have a slight cost, as all incoming light is pre-processed before going on to the other parts of hardware. This can lead to very slight signal delay and degradation. It really only becomes a problem in very fast response situations r where visual acuity is especially exacting.<br /></p><p><strong>Software</strong><br />All those pretty images have to be understood in order to be useful. As the human mind didn’t evolve with the ability to process more than one visual stream at once, software becomes mandatory.<br /><strong>Image Tracking-</strong> These programs allow the user to mark a targeted object for integration into other programs. For example, in hand to hand combat an enemy’s body can be tracked to ensure a combat program knows how to respond and what options to give the user.<br /><strong>Object Recognition-</strong> When loaded with sufficient data the user can allow his software to do the searching for him. He no longer has to actively look for any object, the software picks the object out of the incoming images and tags it for the user to easily see.<br /><strong>Motion Integration-</strong> This software uses all available visual data (and any other input data it’s allowed access to) to build a useful definition of the space around the user. This allows the user to move through any terrain without having to actively look for thing that might impair the user. The software can identify these dangers and direct the user along the optimum path. If used in conjunction with “body auto-piloting”, the user can direct his body to run at full speed, leaving the processor the task of keeping him moving, while he merely dictates the significant decisions like direction and strategy. Keep in mind this software is only as good as its input data.<br /><strong>Signal Filtering-</strong> Just like the name says, this software can filter different bandwidths of input to isolate any designated frequency (or set of frequencies) the user can perceive. This same software can be hooked into all the other available senses to allow the user to truly define their own perceptions of their current environment.<br /><strong>Level Clamping-</strong> This program simply clamps the incoming signal to a defined magnitude. It’s really just a fancy fuse to protect Neural Nanonics from damage overload. However if this program has to be used, it’s a good bet the organ used to accept the signal has been fried.<br /><strong>Image Overlay-</strong> A very basic feature of almost all Neural Nanonic packages, this software does just what it says on the box. The user can have opaque, transparent or completely vision obscuring images laid over their current visual input. Picture – In – Picture, Rewind, whatever.<br /><strong>Signal Encryption-</strong> Using the Quantum Key Server/Node system, an as-yet unbroken encryption system, all data transmitted to a similarly equipped recipient is completely un-tappable. Each chunk of the data is encrypted separately, using a counter-reliant system. In order to view one coherent image or sound bite, all other parts of the encrypted data path must be encoded as well. As getting through the encoding of one image is incredibly difficult with even the most powerful modern computers or Bitek intellects, getting access to an entire data stream has never happened.<br /></p></blockquote>');
